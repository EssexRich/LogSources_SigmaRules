description: This detection identifies when the ESXi firewall is disabled or set to 
  permissive mode, which can expose the host to unauthorized access and network-based 
  attacks. Such changes are often a precursor to lateral movement, data exfiltration, 
  or the installation of malicious software by a threat actor.
