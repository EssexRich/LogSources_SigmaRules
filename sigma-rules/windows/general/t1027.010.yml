    #             # ordinal can be represented by adding any number of zeros in front ordinal number, for e.g. 000000024
    #             - '#0'
    #             # ordinal is 16 bit ordinal, so if you make the number large enough (don't fit in 16 bit space), then it normally wraps around.
    #             # for e.g ordinal 24 can be also represented by 65560 (65536+24)
